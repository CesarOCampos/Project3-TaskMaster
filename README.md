## Project Description

Do you feel like you and your team are never on the same page? 
Did someone do your task because of a miscommunication and now you have two different versions of the same component? 
Maybe you cant articulate the picture you have in your head but can draw it for your colleagues to understand.
TaskMaster can help with organizing your group’s tasks, 
keeping track of projects, and in the future
collaborate ideas through our drawing board, 
and keep everyone on the right track
Don’t ever miss a deadline, with TaskMaster
